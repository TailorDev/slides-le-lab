# Dive into Le lab

This talk was given in french at the [31st Clermont'ech
APIHour](http://clermontech.org/api-hours/api-hour-31.html).

## Abstract

18 months ago, we had this crazy idea: organize hack weeks dedicated to new tool
and technology learning through the setup of a MVP that could be useful to our
company or our related. While digging into the concept, we realized that this
was a common idea widely used in various digital companies.

In this presentation, I will first introduce our interpretation of the hack week
concept (_aka_ "Le lab" in our jargon), then I will try to convince you to
organize such weeks in your team or company.
